> Collaboration and integrating large research datasets are central to the mission of **CEPLAS**. With a diverse research landscape across four institutions, CEPLAS demands a robust, sustainable data management system. **ARC** and the **DataHub** provide a flexible, adaptable environment for managing and annotating diverse data types, enabling seamless collaboration across institutions and ensuring structured, controlled data exchange both within CEPLAS and with external partners. This empowers us to collaborate efficiently from data acquisition through integration with internationally recognized systems.

        In the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK Gatersleben), research work is dedicated to elucidate fundamental principles of evolution and plant development, improve the adaptability of important crop plants to changing environmental and climate conditions and develop innovative approaches to knowledge-based maintenance, exploration and utilisation of crop plant diversity.

> The implementation of FAIR data standards and research data management practices are of central importance to the mission of IPK Gatersleben. As part of the NFDI4Biodiversity initiative, a network of services has been developed with the objective of enabling users to create and utilize FAIR digital objects. ARC and its associated tooling provide a flexible framework through which an ARC can be created with the ISA Wizard, phenotyping data can be added to this ARC using brapi2arc, and a BrAPI server can be automatically provided through MIRA. This enables us to facilitate the FAIRification of phenotyping data from the initial mobilization of data to its integration within the global ecosystem.

**Biologist-friendly application for creating MIAPPE-compliant metadata**. The MIAPPE Wizard provides a convenient interface for users to generate metadata compliant with configurable metadata checklists, such as the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE) standard. The tool facilitates the direct upload of the new dataset as an ARC to the PLANTDataHUB.

A CLI-based tool to create, manage and share your ARCs.
The major function of the ARC Commander is to set up the ARC directory and put it under version-control for you.
It creates the [ARC Scaffold directory structure]({{INTERNAL_DEV_REPRESENTATION_ARC_SCAFFOLD}}) with the necessary root directories, and provides commands to manipulate metadata.
Useful for cases where ARCs need to be manipulated in bulk, but a full-blown programming environment is not necessary, e.g. for shell scripting.

Swate is a tool for **ontology-driven metadata annotation**.
It provides a familiar, spreadsheet-like work environment that makes it easy to incrementally increase metadata quality of an [ARC Scaffold]({{INTERNAL_DEV_REPRESENTATION_ARC_SCAFFOLD}}).
Swate is integrated into the [ARCitect](#ARCitect), but can also be used as a [standalone-web based tool]({{DATAPLANT_SWATE_ALPHA}}).

# ARC

The official ARC (annotated research context) website!

[arc-rdm.org](https://www.arc-rdm.org)

## Development

### Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) needs to be installed on your machine.

### Local Build

You can build the website locally, to verify the changes you make.

In the command line, run:

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. `npm run dev` to build the site in watch-mode

Then, in the browser, navigate to the localhost address stated in the CI, e.g. `http://localhost:4321/`.
